README - FlickFinder
Project Overview
FlickFinder is a Java-based desktop application that allows users to search for movies using an external API (TMDb). 
Users can view trending movies, search by title, and access detailed movie descriptions. Additionally, the application provides functionality for users to save movies to a favourites list and a watchlist. These lists are saved in a MySQL database for persistence across sessions. 
The application also includes a user login system, a logout feature, and a recommendations engine based on favourite and watchlist data.

Key Features

- User login and logout system connected to a MySQL database.
- Search functionality using TMDb API.
- Trending movies display.
- View movie details.
- Add to favourites and watchlist with persistent storage.
- View saved favourites and watchlist.
- Recommendations system based on user preferences.

Technologies Used

- Java (Swing for UI)
- MySQL (User and movie data persistence)
- JDBC (Database connectivity)
- TMDb API (External movie data)
- Spring annotations (Component tagging)

Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in IntelliJ or any preferred Java IDE.
3. Configure MySQL database and create necessary tables:
   - users
   - user_favorites
   - user_watchlist
4. Update database credentials in the `DatabaseConnection` class.
5. Run the application from the `Main` class.

Future Work

- Improve recommendation logic with genre metadata.
- Add UI enhancements and error handling.
- Implement user registration and password encryption.
- Export favourite/watchlist to CSV or PDF.
